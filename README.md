# OpenIT_Tools_SyslogListenerEmailer
Listens for syslog on udp 514 and emails each one out. This is for urgent stuff and or field deployments. 


add the text files to C: root folder so that failover listeners can be added and SMTP info can be semi-securely propagated and removed from host system when complete

example files are included in the repo
